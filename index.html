<font size="+2"><p>Endangered animals are something that we should all be aware of. Throughout history, various species have been wiped out for the benefit of humans. Some of these species include the Quagga, Tasmanian Tiger, Dodo bird, and many more. Many have gone extinct because of poaching and deforestation. As of now, various species are still in critical danger and need our help or they'll soon end up going extinct as well.</p></font>
